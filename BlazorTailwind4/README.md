# Tailwind v4 with Blazor - It just got easier

**Tailwind** version 4 [was just released](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4). With the new CLI, it is just so much easier to use tailwindcss with **Blazor**. So in this post, I will show you how to use the new CLI to create a new Blazor project with Tailwind v4.

Short desclaimer: If you still want to use version 3, I already wrote an article about this some time ago: [*"Blazor with TailwindCSS"*](https://steven-giesel.com/blogPost/351838ba-e308-4a09-b9f6-75bb95c39610/blazor-with-tailwindcss).
